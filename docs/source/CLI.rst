| GSPM is composed of 2 major commands:
| ``install`` and literally anything else.

``install``
===========

| The ``install`` command can be ran via
``python gspm-cmd.py install <PACKAGENAME>``.
| The ``install`` command will then prompt you which package on Git(Hub)
you want to install.
| Type the corresponding number into the command line, and then GSPM
will auto-install and build the project.

any other (nonexistant) command
===============================

This will prompt you with the following message:

::

    GSPM v1.0.0 (gitStall Psuedo-Package Manager)
    GSPM + Psitfile (PSuedo gIT file)

    Commands:
    `base` == main exe filename
    `package` == package name on git
    `s_any` == any string

    #`[base] install [package]`
    Installs a package and runs the Psitfile included.
    #`[base] [s_any]`
    Provides help.
